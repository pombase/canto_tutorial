# Canto tutorial

This site contains a step-by-step guide for curating a paper using Canto. If you have received a link to curate a publication, follow the instructions below. If you want to curate a paper, but have not received a link, see [this page](./request_curation_session.md).

## Getting started

* Click on the email you have received, this should open Canto in your browser.
* Click on `Start curating`.
* You will be required to log in. Enter your information and click `Continue`.
* In the next page, you can add the list of genes that are mentioned in the paper and that you will be using for annotations later.
    * You can add multiple genes separated by any spacer (space, commas, line breaks).
    * You can refer to genes by their systematic id (SPAC3G9.12), primary name (peg1) or a synonym (cls1).
    * If a gene name is also the synonym of another gene (e.g. psu1), you will be asked to provide a primary name for that gene.
    * You can add genes later, so no need to include an exhaustive list at this point.
* You will then be asked to double-check the list of genes, and then you can proceed to curating your paper.

## Creating annotations

Depending on the publication, you may be able to add different types of annotations, follow the links below to see how to do it:

* Gene Ontology:
    * [Molecular Function](./go_MF.md): single-step activities such as `kinase activity` or `transporter activity`.
    * [Biological Process](./go_BP.md): a series of functions with a common goal such as `MAPK cascade` or `cytokinesis`.
    * [Cellular Component](./go_CC.md): location where the gene product can be found, and what complexes it is part of, for instance `nucleus` or `fatty acid synthase complex`.
* Phenotypes:
