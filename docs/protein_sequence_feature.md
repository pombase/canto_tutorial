Protein sequence features include nuclear localisation signals, signal peptides, etc. To make an annotation click on `Protein sequence feature or motif` on the `Quick Links` list, and indicate:

* **Gene**: the gene that exhibits that protein sequence. See [how to add genes](./genotype_management.md#adding-genes-info)
* **Term name**: the type of sequence features / motif. All possible options are displayed when you click on the text box. You can request the addition via [email](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org).
* **Annotation extensions**: available once a term is selected. You can use it to specify the range of residues involved in the format `K23-K30`.
* **Evidence code**: the evidence that supports the present of that feature / motif, which can come from:
    * An experiment (EXP)
    * Sequence similarity with another gene known to have the same feature (ISS). The gene must be in the session. If you want to annotate similarity to a gene from another species, let us know when you submit your curation session.
* **Comment**: it's very useful for us if you indicate the figure or table where this interaction comes from.
