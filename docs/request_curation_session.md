If you have not received a link from the PomBase team to curate a publication, you can easily send a request and we will send you an email with a link shortly.

If the publication is in PubMed, you can search for it in the PomBase searchbar, and request to curate that publication (see animation below). If the publication is not in PomBase, send an email to [helpdesk@pombase.org](mailto:helpdesk@pombase.org) indicating the title of the publication you want to curate.
