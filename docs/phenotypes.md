!!! info "To make phenotype annotations, you need to add genotypes first: see [how to add genotypes](./genes_alleles_genotypes.md)"

## Making an annotation

On the `Quick Links` list, click on `Phenotype`, it should open a window that requires you to indicate:

  * **Genotype:** you can choose from the previously created genotypes (see [how to add genotypes](./genes_alleles_genotypes.md)). You can click on the magnifying glass on the right to use a search box instead of a drop-down menu.
  * **Term name:** a FYPO term describing the phenotype associated with the genotype you selected above.
      * Start typing a phenotype in the search box. If you do not find what you are looking for, choose a broad term (e.g. abnormal spindle).
      * Click a term, and verify that the displayed definition describes the phenotype you want to annotate. There might be a "Comment" section with extra tips for annotation.
      * If the blue button reads `Next`, click it and see if you can find a more specific term that the one you originally selected. If so, select it and do as before.
      * Otherwise, click `Finish`.
  * **Annotation extension:** once
