??? warning "Before you make a GO annotation"

    * Gene Ontology (GO) annotations are used to describe the normal (wild type) functions, processes and cellular components or locations of a gene product (protein or RNA).
    * A **Biological Process** is a series of events accomplished by one or more ordered assemblies of molecular functions. Some examples are "cell cycle regulation", "ion transport", or "signal transduction".
    * It can be difficult to distinguish between a biological process and a molecular function, but the general rule is that a process must have more than one distinct step.
    * Gene products may be annotated with multiple biological process terms.
    * Because GO annotation describes the wild-type functions of genes, a phenotype that perturbs a certain biological process is not sufficient to annotate a gene to a molecular process. For instance, the fact that deleting a gene perturbs spindle assembly assembly is not sufficient evidence to annotate that gene to the biological process "spindle assembly", or even "regulation of spindle assembly".
    * Experiment with mutants can be used to support a GO annotation, but they must show direct involvement of the gene in the process.
