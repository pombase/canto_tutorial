!!! info "These annotations can also be submitted in bulk format, see our [submission guidelines](https://www.pombase.org/submit-data/bulk-annotation)"

You can use these annotations to qualitatively describe whether protein or RNA levels change in wild type cells:

* In presence of chemicals / drugs (e.g. RNA level unchanged in presence of rapamycin)
* During a cell cycle phase (e.g. RNA absent during meiosis I)
* During cellular response to stimulus (e.g. protein level increased during heat response)

To make an annotation click on `Wild-type RNA level` or `Wild-type protein level` on the `Quick Links` list, and indicate:

* **Gene**: the gene concerned. See [how to add genes](./genotype_management.md#adding-genes-info)
* **Term name**: a term describing the qualitative change.
* **Annotation extensions**: available once a term is selected.
    * **during**: the cell cycle phase / cellular response to stimulus where the qualitative change happens.
    * **in presence of**: a drug or chemical.
* **Evidence code**: the evidence that supports the present of that feature / motif, which can come from:
    * An experiment (EXP)
    * Sequence similarity with another gene known to have the same feature (ISS). The gene must be in the session. If you want to annotate similarity to a gene from another species, let us know when you submit your curation session.
* **Comment**: it's very useful for us if you indicate the figure or table where this interaction comes from.
